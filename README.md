WebM for Lazys [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/g0gybayk8rw86aa1/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nixxquality/webmconverter/branch/master)
=============
A wrapper around ffmpeg and AviSynth made for converting videos to WebM without having to use the command line.

- **Download it [here][LatestDownload].**

Important to know:
* Requires .NET Framework 4.5 (Windows 7 comes with 3.5, so you might want to [update][DotNet45])
* Requires [AviSynth][AviSynth] (2.6.0, 32-bit)
* Already includes ffmpeg
* Only works on Windows (I assume Linux users don't need GUIs)

This software is released under the MIT license. See LICENSE.md.
